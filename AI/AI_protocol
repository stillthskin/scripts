1. Imports
2. Data pre-proccesing.
        (i)   Get data.
        (ii)  Split to train, test.
        (iii) Create lable based on ouput layer.
        (iv)  Append to train, test, labels lists. 
3. Declare suitable model. sequential for straigh through and non-sequential for loop between neurons. 
4. Add layers to model.
5. Compile model(ready for training).
6. Train model(check for overfit if nessesary).
7. Save model.
8. Test model.
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,Y,test_size=0.2)
tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory()
model.compile(
loss = "mse"
optimiser = "sgd"
metric = ?
) #Tell model how to calculate loss how wrong weigh/biases are optimizer method to update weight and biases and metric calculate diff between lossses.

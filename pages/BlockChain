Blockchain Intuition.

 " For the currency we deserve "
 Blockchain - a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.
 Block -BlockIdD, Nonce, Data, prevHash, ItsHAsh(prev_hash next_node).
 
 The SHA256 Hash - 64 Characters 4-Bit = 256 Bytes.
 Immutable ledger - Change changes previous hash invalidates the chain.
 P2P Distribution  - Immutable ledger on all peers. invalidated chain corrected by the  other valid peers.
 Mining. Nonce(Number Used  only once) Varying the block. without changing the block. mining = Guessing the nonce untill the target is hit(leading zeroz).
 Byzantine Fault Tolerance. 33% Traitor tolererance. The byzantine generals.
 Consesus protocol.  51% consensus. 
 51% attack = 51 % of the hash rate not the nodes. Attacker aims at benefiting from the double spend problem( issoalte their higer hash rate nodes
 from the network and come back as the longest chain and invalidates many blocks)

 To be reviewed.....
 Bit to target conversion.
 cur_target = 0000000000000000005d97dc0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
 max_target = 00000000FFFF0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

 part_2 {
 (UTXO's unspent transactions outputs) <- Input(build) -> Output(sent) -> change(back to UTXO).
 
 (private & public key) private to encrypt message yields a signature.(signature + public = verification).
 private key to generate public key via ECC.
 
 SegregatedWitness(SegWit).
 scriptsig(public_key & signature part of a transaction)
 
 bitcoin address vs public key = Extra layer of security(public_key -> SHA256 -> BTC_address)
 Hierarchically Deterministic(HD) Wallets = one_master_key = more_than_one-private_key = more_public_keys = more_anon_transactions.
